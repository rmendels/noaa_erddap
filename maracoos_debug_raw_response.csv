Additionally, all variables were scanned for extreme outliers: for each variable, data from all stations, depths, and times were combined into a single composite sample for which the 75th and 25th percentiles (i.e., the upper and lower quantiles) and the interquartile range (the difference between the upper and lower quantiles) were calculated.  Extreme outliers were defined as the values falling outside of a certain number (censoring criterion) of interquartile ranges from the upper and lower quantiles."

Additionally, all variables were scanned for extreme outliers: for each variable, data from all stations, depths, and times were combined into a single composite sample for which the 75th and 25th percentiles (i.e., the upper and lower quantiles) and the interquartile range (the difference between the upper and lower quantiles) were calculated.  Extreme outliers were defined as the values falling outside of a certain number (censoring criterion) of interquartile ranges from the upper and lower quantiles."

Additionally, all variables were scanned for extreme outliers: for each variable, data from all stations, depths, and times were combined into a single composite sample for which the 75th and 25th percentiles (i.e., the upper and lower quantiles) and the interquartile range (the difference between the upper and lower quantiles) were calculated.

This deployment also supports the realtime data delivery of autonomous underwater gliders in the coastal ocean to better resolve and understand essential ocean features and processes that contribute to hurricane intensification or weakening prior to making landfall. This is a partnership between NOAA Ocean and Atmospheric Research (OAR) through the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) and Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) regional associations such as MARACOOS, SECOORA, CariCOOS and institutions including the University of Puerto Rico, University of the Virgin Islands, Skidaway Institute of Oceanography, University of Delaware, and Rutgers University. The goal of the project is to provide realtime data for ocean model validation and assimilation throughout hurricane season. This project is supported by the Disaster Recovery Act. The glider was deployed out of Tuckerton, NJ and will transect E to an offshore waypoint north of Carteret Canyon, then transect SSW to Wilmington Canyon, then NW back to Tuckerton, NJ as the battery pack allows.
