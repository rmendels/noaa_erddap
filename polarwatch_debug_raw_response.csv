For information about organizations contributing data to GTSPP, see http://gosic.org/goos/GTSPP-data-flow.htm .  The U.S. National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) maintains the GTSPP Continuously Managed Data Base and releases new 'best-copy' data once per month.\n\nWARNING: This dataset has a *lot* of data.  If you request too much data, your request will fail.\n* If you don't specify a longitude and latitude bounding box, don't request more than a month's data at a time.\n* If you do specify a longitude and latitude bounding box, you can request data for a proportionally longer time period.\nRequesting data for a specific station_id may be slow, but it works.\n\n*** This ERDDAP dataset has data for the entire world for all available times (currently, up to and including the September 2024 data) but is a subset of the original NODC 'best-copy' data.

Moored buoys are the weather\nsentinels of the sea. They are deployed in the coastal and offshore waters\nfrom the western Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean around Hawaii, and from the\nBering Sea to the South Pacific. NDBC's moored buoys measure and transmit\nbarometric pressure; wind direction, speed, and gust; air and sea\ntemperature; and wave energy spectra from which significant wave height,\ndominant wave period, and average wave period are derived. Even the\ndirection of wave propagation is measured on many moored buoys. See\nhttps://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/measdes.shtml for a description of the measurements.\n\nThe source data from NOAA NDBC has different column names, different units,\nand different missing values in different files, and other problems\n(notably, lots of rows with duplicate or different values for the same time\npoint). This dataset is a standardized, reformatted, and lightly edited\nversion of that source data, created by NOAA NMFS SWFSC ERD (email:\nerd.data at noaa.gov). Before 2020-01-29, this dataset only had the data\nthat was closest to a given hour, rounded to the nearest hour. Now, this\ndataset has all of the data available from NDBC with the original time\nvalues. If there are multiple source rows for a given buoy for a given\ntime, only the row with the most non-NaN data values is kept. If there is\na gap in the data, a row of missing values is inserted (which causes a nice\ngap when the data is graphed). Also, some impossible data values are\nremoved, but this data is not perfectly clean. This dataset is now updated\nevery 5 minutes.\n\nThis dataset has both historical data (quality controlled, before\n2023-12-01T00:00:00Z) and near real time data (less quality controlled,\nwhich may change at any time, from 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z on)."

The RADS data for each mission is updated with state of the art corrections for tides, atmospheric path delay, etc. Because they are all computed consistently between the various missions, this avoids the possibility of introducing biases and drifts because of the different implementation of the various corrections by different agencies. The goals of RADS are to provide a homogenous dataset of sea level anomalies, wave heights, and wind speeds, along with database selection and analysis tools."

Instead, the implication is that horizontal dynamics are likely more important to maintaining these biological hotspots than local upwelling. However, coincident measures of phytoplankton, prey fields, and predator locations in their advective context have not been made to establish the ecological importance of horizontal flow.  In this project, we will simultaneously sample across the entire food web from the phytoplankton and prey fields to the top predators to understand the ocean features that support life in these polar systems.  For the first time in this region, we will integrate these glider deployed sensors with moored, remote sensed and small boat platforms to simultaneously map phytoplankton blooms, krill aggregations, and top predator foraging relative to dynamic ocean features.

The Gridded Surface Elevation Product is derived from Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) lidar elevation data acquired during annual, low-altitude NASA Operation IceBridge airborne surveys over Arctic sea ice. IceBridge ATM data were acquired between March and May, 2009 - 2019. Due to the conical scanning geometry of the ATM lidar, across-track sampling is non-uniform, with sampling density greatest at the swath edges. To account for the variation in sample density, ATM elevation data are gridded (See Figure 1 on Data Product Webpage). Each grid cell has an along-track dimension of 30 m and an across-track dimension that is inversely proportional to the across-track sampling density. The grid configuration optimizes ATM sample density providing high-resolution measurements of elevation while still containing enough point measurements for robust statistical calculations.

Port facilities are minimal and access to appropriate vessels for spending extended periods of time at sea is extremely limited.  Autonomous platforms like gliders provide the capability to collect both oceanographic and passive acoustic data for far longer periods of time (weeks to months) and at significantly reduced costs than traditional shipboard or aerial surveys.  We have developed a system to record, detect, classify, and remotely report Arctic and sub-Arctic marine mammal calls in real time from Slocum ocean gliders based on the digital acoustic monitoring (DMON) instrument and the low-frequency detection and classification system (LFDCS). The system was successfully demonstrated for Arctic research during three AOOS-funded studies in the Chukchi Sea during September 2013 and 2014, 11 July \u2013 8 September 2015, and from 10 July - 4 october 2016.

The North Pacific Fisheries Management Council (NPFMC) establishes Alaska as a world leader in the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM) for maintaining sustainable fisheries (Zador et al., 2017). EAFM requires deep understanding of commercially and non-commercially important species\u2019 biology, population status, and trends in addition to a holistic understanding of environmental drivers, trophic linkages, and many subtle complexities of ecosystem dynamics. A successful implementation of EAFM is based on timely information that guides an informed approach to setting fisheries harvest levels in the context of environmental conditions. Lack of timely ecosystem data is identified as a critical gap in the EAFM process. The purpose of this project is to apply gliders to the task of developing near-real-time indices of key physical and biological parameters that will inform the NPFMC decision-making process, and other marine and fisheries management related research activities."

The data are gridded on the NSIDC polar stereographic grid with 25 x 25 km grid cells, and are available in Network Common Data Format (NetCDF) file format. Each file contains a variable with the CDR concentration values as well as variables that hold the input NASA Team and Bootstrap concentrations for reference and a merged NASA Team/Bootstrap version of the Goddard sea ice concentrations that spans 1978 to the present made available as a longer-term analog of the CDR concentrations.

This product is designed to provide a consistent time series of sea ice concentrations (the fraction, or percentage, of ocean area covered by sea ice) from 1987 to the present which spans the coverage of several passive microwave instruments. The data are gridded on the NSIDC polar stereographic grid with 25 x 25 km grid cells, and are available in Network Common Data Format (NetCDF) file format. Each file contains a variable with the CDR concentration values as well as variables that hold the input NASA Team and Bootstrap concentrations for reference and a merged NASA Team/Bootstrap version of the Goddard sea ice concentrations that spans 1978 to the present made available as a longer-term analog of the CDR concentrations. Variables containing standard deviation, quality flags, and projection information are also included. Data are available via FTP."

Version 3 Summary: This data set provides a Climate Data Record (CDR) of sea ice concentration from passive microwave data. It provides a consistent, daily and monthly time series of sea ice concentrations from 09 July 1987 through the most recent processing for both the north and south polar regions. In addition, three other sea ice concentration products are included with the CDR that extend the sea ice measurements back to 26 October 1978. However, these three products are not included in the official CDR because processing the older data in a way that follows the standards of a CDR is not currently possible. All data are on a 25 km x 25 km grid. Variables containing standard deviation, quality flags, and projection information are also included."
