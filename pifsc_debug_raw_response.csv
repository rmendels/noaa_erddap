VIIRS was band-shifted and bias-corrected in a second stage against the MODIS Rrs that had already been corrected to MERIS levels, for the overlap period 2012-2014; at the third stage Sentinel-3A OLCI was bias corrected against already corrected MODIS, for overlap period 2016-07-01 to 2019-06-30;  at the fourth stage Sentinel-3B OLCI was bias corrected against already corrected Sentinel-3A OLCI, for overlap period 2018-07-01 to 2021-06-30.  VIIRS, MODIS, SeaWiFS and MERIS Rrs were derived from a combination of NASA's l2gen (for basic sensor geometry corrections, etc) and HYGEOS POLYMER (for atmospheric correction). OLCI Rrs were sourced at L1b (already geometrically corrected) and processed with POLYMER.  The Rrs were binned to a sinusoidal 4km level-3 grid, and later to 4km geographic projection, by Brockmann Consult's SNAP.  Derived products were generally computed with the standard algorithms through SeaDAS.  QAA IOPs were derived using the standard SeaDAS algorithm but with a modified backscattering table to match that used in the bandshifting.  The final chlorophyll is a combination of OCI, OCI2, OC2 and OCx, depending on the water class memberships.  Uncertainty estimates were added using the fuzzy water classifier and uncertainty estimation algorithm of Tim Moore as documented in Jackson et al (2017). and updated according to Jackson et al.

MODIS Aqua and MERIS were band-shifted and bias-corrected to SeaWiFS bands and values using a temporally and spatially varying scheme based on the overlap years of 2003-2007.  VIIRS was band-shifted and bias-corrected in a second stage against the MODIS Rrs that had already been corrected to SeaWiFS levels, for the overlap period 2012-2013.  VIIRS and SeaWiFS Rrs were derived from standard NASA L2 products; MERIS and MODIS from a combination of NASA's l2gen (for basic sensor geometry corrections, etc) and HYGEOS Polymer v3.5 (for atmospheric correction).  The Rrs were binned to a sinusoidal 4km level-3 grid, and later to 4km geographic projection, by Brockmann Consult's BEAM.  Derived products were generally computed with the standard SeaDAS algorithms.  QAA IOPs were derived using the standard SeaDAS algorithm but with a modified backscattering table to match that used in the bandshifting.  The final chlorophyll is a combination of OC4, Hu's CI and OC5, depending on the water class memberships.  Uncertainty estimates were added using the fuzzy water classifier and uncertainty estimation algorithm of Tim Moore as documented in Jackson et al (2017)."
