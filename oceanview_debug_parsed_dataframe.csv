The dataset consists of data tables containing tagging information, receiver deployment, and receiver detection data from juvenile fall-run Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and Steelhead O. mykiss acoustic telemetry studies conducted in the lower San Joaquin River and Sacramento  San Joaquin River Delta in the Central Valley of California. The data presented here are data used in the publication of United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) annual survival reports submitted in various venues, including San Joaquin River Group Authority (SJGRA) and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR). The studies for the data published here changed over time for both species with Chinook Salmon (2009-2017) and steelhead (2011-2016) utilizing different tagging and receiver technology with HTI 795 LM micro and 795 LD tags with 3-7 kHz receivers (2009-2012), Vemco V4, V5, and V6 tags with 180 kHz receivers (2012-2016), and the juvenile salmon acoustic telemetry system (JSATS) that operates at 416.7 kHz (2017). In a given year, a single telemetry technology was used for the study, but the exact tag may have been different between Chinook salmon (required smaller tags) and steelhead (could use bigger tags). Information on individual fish, tag characteristics and activation times, and release information are contained within the tagging information file. In all years, a network of autonomous receivers was deployed at various locations and near junctions of management relevance (receiver deployment data). The locations of the receiver deployments changed between years. In all studies, a proportion of fish were released at Durham Ferry (50-100%) and detected by the network of autonomous receivers when fish passed by the receivers (receiver detection data). The raw data downloaded from the receivers were processed into either an approximate hourly time scale (HTI) or event data (VEMCO, JSATS), where unique detection events of a given tag on a given hydrophone are separated by a time gap of 30 minutes.  These studies were a collaborative effort between numerous agencies with the USFWS coordinating the efforts and leading the field studies (tagging and receiver deployment/retrieval), USBR providing funding and project planning, U.S. Geological Survey with receiver deployment/retrieval and raw telemetry data processing, and researchers from the University of Washington leading analysis efforts and guiding changes in study design/sample sizes between years.  \n\nReports from these studies.  \n\nBarnard, D., Brandes, P., D.

The dataset consists of data tables containing tagging information, receiver deployment, and receiver detection data from juvenile fall-run Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and Steelhead O. mykiss acoustic telemetry studies conducted in the lower San Joaquin River and Sacramento  San Joaquin River Delta in the Central Valley of California. The data presented here are data used in the publication of United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) annual survival reports submitted in various venues, including San Joaquin River Group Authority (SJGRA) and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR). The studies for the data published here changed over time for both species with Chinook Salmon (2009-2017) and steelhead (2011-2016) utilizing different tagging and receiver technology with HTI 795 LM micro and 795 LD tags with 3-7 kHz receivers (2009-2012), Vemco V4, V5, and V6 tags with 180 kHz receivers (2012-2016), and the juvenile salmon acoustic telemetry system (JSATS) that operates at 416.7 kHz (2017). In a given year, a single telemetry technology was used for the study, but the exact tag may have been different between Chinook salmon (required smaller tags) and steelhead (could use bigger tags). Information on individual fish, tag characteristics and activation times, and release information are contained within the tagging information file. In all years, a network of autonomous receivers was deployed at various locations and near junctions of management relevance (receiver deployment data). The locations of the receiver deployments changed between years. In all studies, a proportion of fish were released at Durham Ferry (50-100%) and detected by the network of autonomous receivers when fish passed by the receivers (receiver detection data). The raw data downloaded from the receivers were processed into either an approximate hourly time scale (HTI) or event data (VEMCO, JSATS), where unique detection events of a given tag on a given hydrophone are separated by a time gap of 30 minutes.  These studies were a collaborative effort between numerous agencies with the USFWS coordinating the efforts and leading the field studies (tagging and receiver deployment/retrieval), USBR providing funding and project planning, U.S. Geological Survey with receiver deployment/retrieval and raw telemetry data processing, and researchers from the University of Washington leading analysis efforts and guiding changes in study design/sample sizes between years.  \n\nReports from these studies.  \n\nBarnard, D., Brandes, P., D.

Unlike other food habits databases that typically incorporate samples collected during standardized, regularly occurring survey, the CCTD was compiled from a broad range of data sets, representing both systematic collections and data collected during directed trophic studies by National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) scientists, graduate students, and academic researchers. Twenty-four data sets, including stomach or scat samples, were contributed from collaborators at NMFS- SWFSC, NMFS-Northwest Fisheries Science Center, NMFS-Alaska Fisheries Science Center, and academic institutions (University of California, Santa Cruz; Oregon State University; Moss Landing Marine Laboratories). Once acquired, data were reviewed, standardized with communication and input from contributors, and synthesized. In total, diet composition data were obtained from 105,694 individual predators among 143 taxa collected throughout the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME) from 1967-2019. These taxa consist of squids (n=5), elasmobranchs (n=13), bony fishes (n=118), and marine mammals (n=7), including extensive time series for some predators (e.g., California Sea Lion, Pacific Hake, Chinook Salmon). The CCTD is a first step towards a comprehensive database for the CCLME. Our intention is to further augment and periodically update the dataset as additional historical or contemporary data become available to increase its utility and impact. \n\n  The CCTD was created using the Structured Query Language (SQL) and consists of eight data tables. Hierarchical (parent-child) tables include Data Sources, Collection Information, Predator Information, Prey Composition, and Prey Size. The CCTD contains two taxonomic tables, one for predators (n=143) and one for prey (n=1658), that are linked to the Predator Information and Prey Composition tables. The World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) was primarily used for taxonomic reference, and scientific names from each data set were updated accordingly. Additional taxonomic resources (e.g., recent primary literature, California Academy of Fishes Fish Catalog) were incorporated when WoRMS designations seemed dated or unsubstantiated. A stand-alone Glossary of terms also is included. A single flat file that was created from the five hierarchical SQL tables is provided to the public via SWFSC's Environmental Research Division's ERDDAP site, along with stand-alone Glossary, Predator Taxonomy, and Prey Taxonomy tables."

Twenty-four data sets, including stomach or scat samples, were contributed from collaborators at NMFS- SWFSC, NMFS-Northwest Fisheries Science Center, NMFS-Alaska Fisheries Science Center, and academic institutions (University of California, Santa Cruz; Oregon State University; Moss Landing Marine Laboratories). Once acquired, data were reviewed, standardized with communication and input from contributors, and synthesized. In total, diet composition data were obtained from 105,694 individual predators among 143 taxa collected throughout the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME) from 1967-2019. These taxa consist of squids (n=5), elasmobranchs (n=13), bony fishes (n=118), and marine mammals (n=7), including extensive time series for some predators (e.g., California Sea Lion, Pacific Hake, Chinook Salmon). The CCTD is a first step towards a comprehensive database for the CCLME. Our intention is to further augment and periodically update the dataset as additional historical or contemporary data become available to increase its utility and impact. \n\n  The CCTD was created using the Structured Query Language (SQL) and consists of eight data tables. Hierarchical (parent-child) tables include Data Sources, Collection Information, Predator Information, Prey Composition, and Prey Size. The CCTD contains two taxonomic tables, one for predators (n=143) and one for prey (n=1658), that are linked to the Predator Information and Prey Composition tables. The World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) was primarily used for taxonomic reference, and scientific names from each data set were updated accordingly. Additional taxonomic resources (e.g., recent primary literature, California Academy of Fishes Fish Catalog) were incorporated when WoRMS designations seemed dated or unsubstantiated. A stand-alone Glossary of terms also is included. A single flat file that was created from the five hierarchical SQL tables is provided to the public via SWFSC's Environmental Research Division's ERDDAP site, along with stand-alone Glossary, Predator Taxonomy, and Prey Taxonomy tables."

The dataset consists of data tables containing tagging information, receiver deployment, and receiver detection data from juvenile fall-run Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and Steelhead O. mykiss acoustic telemetry studies conducted in the lower San Joaquin River and Sacramento  San Joaquin River Delta in the Central Valley of California. The data presented here are data used in the publication of United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) annual survival reports submitted in various venues, including San Joaquin River Group Authority (SJGRA) and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR). The studies for the data published here changed over time for both species with Chinook Salmon (2009-2017) and steelhead (2011-2016) utilizing different tagging and receiver technology with HTI 795 LM micro and 795 LD tags with 3-7 kHz receivers (2009-2012), Vemco V4, V5, and V6 tags with 180 kHz receivers (2012-2016), and the juvenile salmon acoustic telemetry system (JSATS) that operates at 416.7 kHz (2017). In a given year, a single telemetry technology was used for the study, but the exact tag may have been different between Chinook salmon (required smaller tags) and steelhead (could use bigger tags). Information on individual fish, tag characteristics and activation times, and release information are contained within the tagging information file. In all years, a network of autonomous receivers was deployed at various locations and near junctions of management relevance (receiver deployment data). The locations of the receiver deployments changed between years. In all studies, a proportion of fish were released at Durham Ferry (50-100%) and detected by the network of autonomous receivers when fish passed by the receivers (receiver detection data). The raw data downloaded from the receivers were processed into either an approximate hourly time scale (HTI) or event data (VEMCO, JSATS), where unique detection events of a given tag on a given hydrophone are separated by a time gap of 30 minutes.  These studies were a collaborative effort between numerous agencies with the USFWS coordinating the efforts and leading the field studies (tagging and receiver deployment/retrieval), USBR providing funding and project planning, U.S. Geological Survey with receiver deployment/retrieval and raw telemetry data processing, and researchers from the University of Washington leading analysis efforts and guiding changes in study design/sample sizes between years.  \n\nReports from these studies.  \n\nBarnard, D., Brandes, P., D.

The dataset consists of data tables containing tagging information, receiver deployment, and receiver detection data from juvenile fall-run Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and Steelhead O. mykiss acoustic telemetry studies conducted in the lower San Joaquin River and Sacramento  San Joaquin River Delta in the Central Valley of California. The data presented here are data used in the publication of United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) annual survival reports submitted in various venues, including San Joaquin River Group Authority (SJGRA) and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR). The studies for the data published here changed over time for both species with Chinook Salmon (2009-2017) and steelhead (2011-2016) utilizing different tagging and receiver technology with HTI 795 LM micro and 795 LD tags with 3-7 kHz receivers (2009-2012), Vemco V4, V5, and V6 tags with 180 kHz receivers (2012-2016), and the juvenile salmon acoustic telemetry system (JSATS) that operates at 416.7 kHz (2017). In a given year, a single telemetry technology was used for the study, but the exact tag may have been different between Chinook salmon (required smaller tags) and steelhead (could use bigger tags). Information on individual fish, tag characteristics and activation times, and release information are contained within the tagging information file. In all years, a network of autonomous receivers was deployed at various locations and near junctions of management relevance (receiver deployment data). The locations of the receiver deployments changed between years. In all studies, a proportion of fish were released at Durham Ferry (50-100%) and detected by the network of autonomous receivers when fish passed by the receivers (receiver detection data). The raw data downloaded from the receivers were processed into either an approximate hourly time scale (HTI) or event data (VEMCO, JSATS), where unique detection events of a given tag on a given hydrophone are separated by a time gap of 30 minutes.

Species distribution models (SDMs) outputs were previously fitted using boosted regression trees (BRTs) models with physical environmental variables. These variables were extracted from an implementation of the regional ocean modelling system (ROMS) for the California Current region (Neveu et al., 2016) using historical re-analysis (1980-2010) and a near real-time product (2011-2020; oceanmodeling.ucsc.edu). The ROMS domain covers the region 30-48 N and 115.5-134 W (midway down Baja California to just south of Cape Flattery, WA) with 0.1 degree (~10 km) horizontal resolution and 42 terrain-following vertical levels (Veneziani et al., 2009). \n\nTo force the HMS projections, we use daily output from the three downscaled ocean projections for the CCS. These downscaled projections are based on an implementation of the same 0.1 degree ROMS domain described above, with bias-corrected forcing obtained from three earth system models (ESMs) for the period from 1980 to 2100 under the RCP8.5 climate scenario (Pozo Buil et al., 2021). Downscaled ESMs were selected to span the range of plausible futures for the CCS, and belong to the phase 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP5) archive: the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory (GFDL) ESM2M, Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL) CM5A-MR and the Hadley Center HadGEM2-ES (HAD). \n\nEight HMS were selected for projecting future distributions based on data availability, their use of the CCS as a foraging hotspot, and economic and conservation importance for the CCS ecosystem (e.g. as catch and bycatch): blue shark (Prionace glauca), swordfish (Xiphias gladius), thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus), shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus), leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), California sea lion (Zalophus californianus), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) and blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus)."

Environmental variability drives large fluctuations in their abundance and distribution. This dataset includes the outputs of Species Distribution Models (SDMs) for 6 key forage species, combining multiple survey datasets with environmental fields from a high-resolution Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) developed at the University of California - Santa Cruz, and the Copernicus-Globcolour level 4 interpolated surface chlorophyll product (https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00281). The sardine and anchovy SDMs also included predictors indexing stock biomass (MacCall et al. 2016; Kuriyama et al. 2022; Kuriyama et al. 2024). As temporally continuous salinity fields are not available from the UCSC ROMS, we included a measure of the distance to the nearest major river (mean > 50,000 CFS discharge) in the herring SDM, to capture the association of this species with estuaries.\n\nThe species represented are Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), market squid (Doryteuthis opalescens), Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus), and Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus). Results from two different SDMs are shown: Generalized Additive Models and Boosted Regression Trees, and both models predict the probability of occurrence of each species. The model outputs are generally similar, but the BRTs can be more prone to producing offshore artefacts, especially for market squid and jack mackerel. We used data from the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center Coastal Pelagic Species and Columbia River Predator (Emmett et al. 2006) trawl surveys to train all SDMs, with the exception of market squid, where juvenile salmon survey data were used instead (see Chasco et al. 2022 for description of these data). More details on SDMs are available in Muhling et al. (2019); Fennie et al. (2022), and Quezada et al. (2023).\n\nImportant caveat for the sardine SDMs: these models use spawning stock biomass from the stock assessment as an indicator. Since 2022, Japanese sardine (S. melanostictus) have been detected in the California Current System in increasing numbers. These animals are excluded from the stock assessment using genetic identification, so there are likely to be more total sardine in the region than predicted by the sardine SDM.\n\nThese outputs are free to use, but we strongly recommend contacting Barbara Muhling (Barbara.Muhling@noaa.gov) before working with them, to ensure complete understanding of the details and caveats. Fields are updated on ERDDAP about once per year, but additional updates can be pushed upon request.

Data are log(CPUE+1) transformed, with geometric means calculated on non-zero data. Note: Sampling effort was greatly reduced in time and space during 2020 due to COVID restrictions, and associated data reflected substantial bias for many taxa. Catches were standardized by using a Bayesian delta-GLM to estimate year effects while accounting for spatial and temporal covariates, and to estimate approximate 95% confidence limits; see Santora et al. 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-26484-5) for model approaches used to develop alternative indices in 2020.

Grid points between 30-48 degrees N and from the shore out to 150 km offshore are used in the analysis. Additional Calculations: In eastern boundary upwelling ecosystems the spatial footprint of cool upwelled water is regularly demarcated by the differential boundary of warmer oceanic water offshore from cooler coastal water, with upwelling conditions varying with latitude. Therefore, the goal of the habitat compression index (HCI) is to track the area of cool surface waters as an index of potential 'upwelling habitat' for assessing the spatio-temporal aspects of upwelling. Upwelling patterns of cold nutrient-rich water are clearly assessed by models and satellite observations and classified spatially by monitoring SST values less than and equal to a monthly resolved temperature threshold. The HCI tracks the amount of area, determined by the number of grid cells in the model with 2 m surface temperature values less than the monthly temperature threshold, therefore the time series reflects the area of cool water adjacent to the coastline and provides a measure for how compressed cool surface temperatures may be in a particular month. In this study (Schroeder et al. 2022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X22009931), we extracted modeled 2 m temperature fields over the domain of 35.5-40 degree N for each month and tracked the amount of area with temperature values less than and equal to a monthly temperature threshold, resulting in monthly time series starting January 1980. Monthly temperature thresholds for a given month is the spatial average of 2 m temperature grid cells between 35.5-40N from shore out to 75 km for the time period 1980-2010. Cool expansion periods (low compression) are defined as months with HCI values exceeding + 1 standard deviation (SD) of the full time series, limited cool habitat (high compression) where area of cool water is less than the mean (MN) of the full time series, and periods of medium compression when the area of cool water falls between the +1 SD and the MN."

Skipjack have historically been difficult to assess with standard stock assessment methods, due to high and variable productivity, and uncertainties in natural mortality and growth.

A conservative proxy for the target biomass of spawning biomass ratio (SBR) = 0.3, and the fishing mortality corresponding to that biomass, were used as the target reference points. The reference model estimated that the current fishing mortality is below the level corresponding to the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) proxy and the spawning biomass is above the dynamic level corresponding to the MSY proxy. In addition, the spawning biomass does not have a 10% or more probability of exceeding the limit. The stock assessment is completed through the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC).

The social and gentrification pressure vulnerability indices were calculated with U.S. Census American Community Survey (ACS) five year rolling average estimate data from 2005-2009 to 2016-2020. The commercial fisheries indicators were developed using NOAA Fisheries landings data from 2009 to 2020. The recreational fisheries indicators were developed from 2009 to 2020 with NOAA fisheries and/or state data unique to each region. The social and gentrification pressure vulnerability indices data series were paired with commercial and recreational fisheries indicators from the final year in each data series. For example, the 2005 to 2009 social indicator data series are paired with 2009 fisheries indicators. The sea level rise risk indicator was initially developed in 2015 and updated in 2020 for all coastal states except Alaska due to the unavailability of data. The updated sea level rise risk indicator was paired with 2016-2020 social indicator data series and 2020 fisheries data. The storm surge risk indicator was developed in 2015 for Gulf Coast and Eastern U.S. communities due to hurricane risk. Storm surge risk indicator was introduced in 2015 and paired with 2011 to 2015 social indicator data series and 2015 fisheries data. Both sea level rise risk and storm surge risk indicators will be repeated annually until updated."

First, boosted regression tree models were fit to determine the habitat preferences of the target species, broadbill swordfish (Xiphias gladius), and three bycatch-sensitive species that interact with the California drift gillnet fishery (leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coricea), blue shark (Prionace glauca), California sea lion (Zalophus californianus)). Then, individual species weightings were set to reflect the level of bycatch and management concern for each species. Prediction layers for each species were then combined into a single surface by multiplying the layer by the species weighting, summing the layers, and then re-calculating the range of values in the final predictive surface from -1 (low catch & high bycatch probabilities) to 1 (high catch & low bycatch probabilities)."

The availability of these data does not constitute publication of the data. These data have not been post-calibrated or quality controlled and are therefore not of the climate quality (less than 2uatm pCO2) that PMEL is required to achieve.  These unverified data are made available to our partners for qualitative use (e.g., generating plots for public outreach and pre-publication analyses). We rely on the ethics and integrity of the user to assure that PMEL receives fair credit for our work.

Since there is a  less than 1 day delay in flagging bad data, we ask that if the user is generating public plots, that they update the entire time series daily, not just the last day of measurements. From time to time, we may make changes to our database that could affect the data file name, and columns and column names of the data in these files. We will strive to inform you in advance of such changes. If you have any questions, please contact adrienne.sutton@noaa.gov.

The index estimates the difference between observed revenue concentrations and what they would be if they were perfectly equally distributed across ports; higher values indicate greater concentration in a subset of ports. We calculate the Theil Index for total fisheries and for specific management groups, at the scale of the 21 port groups previously established for the economic Input-Output model for Pacific Coast fisheries (IO-PAC; Leonard and Watson 2011)."

As female salmon returned to freshwater spawning grounds with low levels of this essential vitamin, they provided insufficient thiamine to their eggs, inhibiting proper development. This led to increased mortality rates among juveniles in hatcheries, with surviving fish exhibiting symptoms of TDC, such as erratic swimming and lethargy. In response, a collaborative effort involving multiple agencies began to investigate the prevalence and impacts of thiamine deficiency in California salmonids. <p>To assess thiamine deficiency and its effects over time, egg thiamine levels have been systematically measured at various hatcheries in central and northern California. Unfertilized eggs from mature Chinook salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i>), Steelhead trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>), and coho salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus kisutch</i>) were collected across California to measure thiamine concentrations. This ongoing surveillance has shown a rising incidence of TDC in nearly all populations in California&rsquo;s Central Valley and coastal hatcheries. Additionally, laboratory studies have investigated the relationship between egg thiamine concentration and offspring survival, helping to understand population-level impacts of thiamine-dependent mortalities."
