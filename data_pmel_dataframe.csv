The drones were each equipped with full atmospheric and ocean core sensor suite, and an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) (not included in this file). SD1029 & SD1030 also carried shortwave and longwave radiation (included in core set) and an ASVCO2 carbon flux and pH system; these carbon data are served in a separate file. SD1029 had 3 strap-on SBE56 temperature sensors (at 0.35m, 1.16m, and 1.72m) to study the near-surface stratification. For the Gen5 drones, the core Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD) was an RBR located in the flowthrough tunnel in the keel. The carbon system also had an independent prawler CTD that is higher quality than the RBR. The vehicles were deployed out of Honolulu, HI on October 3, 2018. After sailing near a PMEL Carbon mooring in Kaneohe Bay, HI, the drones proceeded to the Tropical Atmosphere/Ocean (TAO) mooring at 9N, 140W. Three drones completed a circuit around the mooring, and then began their transit south towards the equator. Two drones made it to the equator and sailed near the TAO moorings at 0, 140W.  Navigation issues caused the mission to be aborted early (mid-December 2018), before further science tasks could be completed. Three Saildrones were recovered in Honolulu on 01-27-19. SD1030 was recovered in HI later in the spring of 2019."

Following its ADCP bottom tracking tested again, on 20 June 2019 all 4 drones began their transit to the Tropical Atmosphere/Ocean (TAO) mooring at 9N, 140W, and then south towards the equator. In addition to intercomparisons against the 0N, 140W TAO buoy, several experiments were performed to survey scales of variability in the equatorial region and the structure of the cold tongue front. An experiment in the InterTropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) was then performed before returning to Hawaii for a final intercomparison against the WHOTS mooring, a newly deployed PMEL test TELOS surface mooring and test PRAWLER mooring which carried a test Z-Cell ADCP on its bridal. The mission ended on December 20, 2019. All four Saildrones were recovered in Honolulu in early January 2020."

The drones then proceeded south along the 110W Tropical Atmosphere/Ocean (TAO) mooring line, completing two intercomparisons at the 8N, 110W and 5N, 110W TAO buoys. The drones also sampled the strong meridional Sea Surface Temperature (SST) front separating the warm waters of the northern hemisphere ITCZ from the cold waters of the equatorial Cold Tongue. The drones became separated en route to the equatorial study region due to strong easterly ocean currents, with SD1065 eventually crossing the Equator to survey the southern hemisphere ""double"" ITCZ regime.

Uncrewed Surface Vehicle (USV) (i.e., ""saildrone"") core MetOcean sensors for the NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) TPOS 2023 Mission (Mission 6) to the central tropical Pacific along the 155\u00b0W meridian, west along the equator, and returning north roughly along the 170\u00b0W meridian. This mission was funded by NOAA OMAO UxSOC and the UMS 2022 project to implement the Research to Operations - Component Service Transition Plan Volume 1-C ""Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USV) integrated within the Tropical Pacific Observing System (TPOS)"". This TPOS-2023 mission, focused on observing air-sea interaction processes and CO2 fluxes associated with the developing 2023 El Nino, an equatorial upwelling experiment near 0\u00b0N 153.5\u00b0W, a comparison with R/V Antea near 0\u00b0N 166\u00b0W, and several National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoy flybys.  A pre-mission comparison against the WHOTS mooring was also conducted from May 30 - June 2, 2023.  The PIs were Dr. Meghan Cronin (NOAA PMEL), Dr. Dongxiao Zhang (UW Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Studies (UW CICOES)), Dr. Adrienne Sutton (NOAA PMEL), Dr. Samantha Wills (UW/CICOES), Dr. R\u00e9ka Domokos (NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) Ecosystem Services Division (ESD)), Karen Grissom (NOAA NDBC), Eugene Burger (NOAA PMEL), Yolande Serra (UW CICOES), Dr. Arun Kumar (NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)), Dr. Jack Reeves Eyre (NOAA NCEP and ERT), and Jieshun Zhu (NOAA NCEP). Mr. Nathan Anderson (UW CICOES) contributed to the metadata creation.  The PMEL TPOS 2023 Mission (aka Mission 6) had three Saildrones: SD1030, SD1033, and SD1079.  All were standard Gen 6 drones with the core MetOcean package and an ASVCO2 Gen2 carbon flux system.  SD1030 and SD1033 were equipped with Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) at 1.86m (not included in this file) and SD1079 with an EK80 echo sounder.  The collaboration with NMFS facilitated the addition of the echo sounder to explore the value of combining physical and fish biomass surveys of the Pacific Islands Regions, with the collaboration's goal of connecting the life cycle with the energy, water, and carbon cycles to improve ecosystem forecasts within Earth system models.  The core Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD) sensor was an SBE 37-SMP at 1.7m, and a temperature logger RBR Coda^3 T at 0.5m, with 3x PMEL-provided self-logging SBE56 Temperature sensors at 0.355m, 0.775m, and 1.155m.  All drones had a PMEL-provided SPN1 shielded shortwave radiometer and a Kipp and Zonen longwave radiometer.  Carbon system data (including the CTD data) are served through a separate file.  EK80 data will also be provided as a separate file.

This 2019 Arctic Saildrone Mission was a joint effort betweenNOAA\ufffds Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) and Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), the NOAA/University of Washington Joint Institute for the Study of the Ocean and Atmosphere (Joint Institue for the Study of Atmoshere and Ocean (JISAO)), and the National Ocean Partnership Program (NOPP) Arctic MISST (Multi-sensor Improved Sea Surface Temperature) study. The overall mission objective was to measure atmospheric, oceanographic, fishery and fur seal conditions in the US arctic. One USV (sd-1041) remained in the Bering Sea measuring fish acoustic backscatter and conducting focal follows of threatened fur seals for AFSC. Five saildrones transited Bering Strait into the Chukchi Sea. One of those (sd-1033) surveyed lines in Distributed Biological Observatories (DBO) 1-5. The remaining four (PMEL sd-1034, sd-1035 and MISST sd-1036, sd-1037) ran transects in the Chukchi Sea and approached the southern sea ice edge in the Arctic Ocean up to ~75\ufffdN to measure air-sea heat and momentum flux near sea ice and to validate satellite sea-surface temperature measurements in the arctic. Each saildrone was equipped to measure solar irradiance, air temperature and relative humidity, barometric pressure, surface skin temperature, wind speed and direction, wave height and period, seawater temperature and salinity, chlorophyll fluorescence, and dissolved oxygen. Four cameras aboard each USV imaged up, down, port and starboard of the wing. Saildrones sd-1033 and sd-1034 had Autonomous Surface Vehicle CO2 (ASVCO2) systems measuring seawater pH, temperature, salinity and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2). Vehicles sd-1033, sd-1034, sd-1035, sd-1036 and sd-1037 measured near surface currents with 300 kHz acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCP). Sd-1041 carried Simrad WBT Mini and ES38-18/200-18C fisheries echosounders. There were about two dozen encounters with free-floating sea ice between the four Chukchi Sea/Arctic Ocean saildrones. Sd-1035 was caught in sea ice and rendered barely maneuverable with rudder damage about 24 August. Its mission ended early on 10 September after which it was towed into Point Barrow. The remaining saildrones sampled Bering Sea transects and returned to Dutch Harbor on 11 October after sailing side-by-side for a few hours on an end-of-mission comparison. Other supporting measurements were made during this mission. The PMEL/WHOI/JISAO Arctic Heat Open Science Experiment dropped AXBTs on 16-22 July. USCGC Healy met sd-1033 on 11 August for a pCO2 cross-calibration. Sd-1034 and sd-1035 sailed near the sites of periodic surfacings of Marine Robotic Vehicles (MRV) Air-Launched Autonomous Micro-Observer (ALAMO) float 9234.

Vehicles sd-1033, sd-1034, sd-1035, sd-1036 and sd-1037 measured near surface currents with 300 kHz acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCP). Sd-1041 carried Simrad WBT Mini and ES38-18/200-18C fisheries echosounders. There were about two dozen encounters with free-floating sea ice between the four Chukchi Sea/Arctic Ocean saildrones. Sd-1035 was caught in sea ice and rendered barely maneuverable with rudder damage about 24 August. Its mission ended early on 10 September after which it was towed into Point Barrow. The remaining saildrones sampled Bering Sea transects and returned to Dutch Harbor on 11 October after sailing side-by-side for a few hours on an end-of-mission comparison. Other supporting measurements were made during this mission. The PMEL/WHOI/JISAO Arctic Heat Open Science Experiment dropped AXBTs on 16-22 July. USCGC Healy met sd-1033 on 11 August for a pCO2 cross-calibration. Sd-1034 and sd-1035 sailed near the sites of periodic surfacings of Marine Robotic Vehicles (MRV) Air-Launched Autonomous Micro-Observer (ALAMO) float 9234.

The mast extended 5 m above and forward of the aerosol measurement container. The inlet was a rotating cone-shaped nozzle that was automatically positioned into the relative wind to maintain nominally isokinetic flow and minimize the loss of supermicrometer particles. Air entered the inlet through a 5 cm diameter hole, passed through a 7 degree expansion cone, and then into the 20 cm inner diameter sampling mast. The flow through the mast was 1 m3 min-1. The transmission efficiency of the inlet for particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 6.5 um (the largest size tested) is greater than 95% [Bates et al., 2002].\n\nThe bottom 1.5 m of the mast were heated to establish a stable reference relative humidity (RH) for the sample air controlled to the indicated target sample RH. Twenty one 1.6 cm inner diameter stainless steel tubes extending into the heated portion of the mast were connected to downstream aerosol instrumentation with either conductive silicon tubing or stainless steel tubing for analysis of organic aerosol.\n\nDMPS (datasets denoted by _aerosol_sizedist_dmps_):\nOne of the twenty one 1.6 cm diameter tubes was used to supply ambient air to a tandem DMPS system that measured particle size distributions in the range of 0.020 to 0.8 micrometers Stokes diameter. The tandem DMPS consists of an ""Aitken"" DMPS (0.020 to 0.2 um) and an ""Accumulation"" DMPS (0.2 to 0.8 um). The distributions have been cleaned of all data from times of instrument malfunction or calibration.\n\nAPS (datasets denoted by _aerosol_sizedist_aps_):\nOne of the twenty one 1.6 cm diameter tubes was used to supply ambient air to an APS that measured particle size distributions in the range of 0.96 to 10 micrometers Stokes diameter. The APS diameters are aerodynamic and have not been corrected to Stokes diameter via calculation or estimates of particle density. The APS data larger than 10 micrometers are not useful due to significant particle losses in the inlets including the ship's sampling mast, distribution tubing and APS inlet. The distributions have been cleaned of all data from times of instrument malfunction or calibration.\n\nMerged (datasets denoted by _aerosol_sizedist):\nThese datasets include particle size distributions in the diameter range of 0.005 to 10 micrometers Stokes diameter. The distributions are a combination of DMPS and APS size distribution data where the APS diameters have been converted to Stokes diameters using densities calculated from measured chemistry. The diameter channels in the overlap region were chosen in the following manner: the last DMPS channel was discarded and, after converting to Stokes diameters, the first APS diameter channel that was larger than the last valid DMPS channel was chosen as the first APS channel.

The tandem DMPS consists of an ""Aitken"" DMPS (0.020 to 0.2 um) and an ""Accumulation"" DMPS (0.2 to 0.8 um).

The APS diameters are aerodynamic and have not been corrected to Stokes diameter via calculation or estimates of particle density. The APS data larger than 10 micrometers are not useful due to significant particle losses in the inlets including the ship's sampling mast, distribution tubing and APS inlet. The distributions have been cleaned of all data from times of instrument malfunction or calibration.\n\nMerged (datasets denoted by _aerosol_sizedist):\nThese datasets include particle size distributions in the diameter range of 0.005 to 10 micrometers Stokes diameter. The distributions are a combination of DMPS and APS size distribution data where the APS diameters have been converted to Stokes diameters using densities calculated from measured chemistry. The diameter channels in the overlap region were chosen in the following manner: the last DMPS channel was discarded and, after converting to Stokes diameters, the first APS diameter channel that was larger than the last valid DMPS channel was chosen as the first APS channel. Each combined distribution was regridded onto a common set of diameters. Finally, the regridded distributions were cleaned to eliminate values at the larger sizes from the APS where ""phantom"" counts resulted in a spurious coarse mode in the surface and volume distributions.\n\nAll datasets include number size distributions (normalized and non-normalized) as well as the higher moments for each: surface area and volume.\n\nAdditional datasets may be included for a give project that include:\n - ambient (_ambient_): includes size distributions shifted to ambient RH using gRH factors\n - filter (_filter_): includes size distributions where additional cleaning was performed for periods of unstable CN concentrations"

PMEL Size Distributions\n    \n    Aerosol inlet:\nAmbient aerosol particles were sampled at 18 m above sea level through a heated mast. The mast extended 5 m above and forward of the aerosol measurement container. The inlet was a rotating cone-shaped nozzle that was automatically positioned into the relative wind to maintain nominally isokinetic flow and minimize the loss of supermicrometer particles. Air entered the inlet through a 5 cm diameter hole, passed through a 7 degree expansion cone, and then into the 20 cm inner diameter sampling mast. The flow through the mast was 1 m3 min-1. The transmission efficiency of the inlet for particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 6.5 um (the largest size tested) is greater than 95% [Bates et al., 2002].\n\nThe bottom 1.5 m of the mast were heated to establish a stable reference relative humidity (RH) for the sample air controlled to the indicated target sample RH. Twenty one 1.6 cm inner diameter stainless steel tubes extending into the heated portion of the mast were connected to downstream aerosol instrumentation with either conductive silicon tubing or stainless steel tubing for analysis of organic aerosol.\n\nDMPS (datasets denoted by _aerosol_sizedist_dmps_):\nOne of the twenty one 1.6 cm diameter tubes was used to supply ambient air to a tandem DMPS system that measured particle size distributions in the range of 0.020 to 0.8 micrometers Stokes diameter. The tandem DMPS consists of an ""Aitken"" DMPS (0.020 to 0.2 um) and an ""Accumulation"" DMPS (0.2 to 0.8 um).

The APS diameters are aerodynamic and have not been corrected to Stokes diameter via calculation or estimates of particle density. The APS data larger than 10 micrometers are not useful due to significant particle losses in the inlets including the ship's sampling mast, distribution tubing and APS inlet.

The diameter channels in the overlap region were chosen in the following manner: the last DMPS channel was discarded and, after converting to Stokes diameters, the first APS diameter channel that was larger than the last valid DMPS channel was chosen as the first APS channel. Each combined distribution was regridded onto a common set of diameters. Finally, the regridded distributions were cleaned to eliminate values at the larger sizes from the APS where ""phantom"" counts resulted in a spurious coarse mode in the surface and volume distributions.\n\nAll datasets include number size distributions (normalized and non-normalized) as well as the higher moments for each: surface area and volume.\n\nAdditional datasets may be included for a give project that include:\n - ambient (_ambient_): includes size distributions shifted to ambient RH using gRH factors\n - filter (_filter_): includes size distributions where additional cleaning was performed for periods of unstable CN concentrations"

The mast extended 5 m above and forward of the aerosol measurement container. The inlet was a rotating cone-shaped nozzle that was automatically positioned into the relative wind to maintain nominally isokinetic flow and minimize the loss of supermicrometer particles. Air entered the inlet through a 5 cm diameter hole, passed through a 7 degree expansion cone, and then into the 20 cm inner diameter sampling mast. The flow through the mast was 1 m3 min-1. The transmission efficiency of the inlet for particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 6.5 um (the largest size tested) is greater than 95% [Bates et al., 2002].\n\nThe bottom 1.5 m of the mast were heated to establish a stable reference relative humidity (RH) for the sample air controlled to the indicated target sample RH. Twenty one 1.6 cm inner diameter stainless steel tubes extending into the heated portion of the mast were connected to downstream aerosol instrumentation with either conductive silicon tubing or stainless steel tubing for analysis of organic aerosol.\n\nDMPS (datasets denoted by _aerosol_sizedist_dmps_):\nOne of the twenty one 1.6 cm diameter tubes was used to supply ambient air to a tandem DMPS system that measured particle size distributions in the range of 0.020 to 0.8 micrometers Stokes diameter. The tandem DMPS consists of an ""Aitken"" DMPS (0.020 to 0.2 um) and an ""Accumulation"" DMPS (0.2 to 0.8 um). The distributions have been cleaned of all data from times of instrument malfunction or calibration.\n\nAPS (datasets denoted by _aerosol_sizedist_aps_):\nOne of the twenty one 1.6 cm diameter tubes was used to supply ambient air to an APS that measured particle size distributions in the range of 0.96 to 10 micrometers Stokes diameter. The APS diameters are aerodynamic and have not been corrected to Stokes diameter via calculation or estimates of particle density. The APS data larger than 10 micrometers are not useful due to significant particle losses in the inlets including the ship's sampling mast, distribution tubing and APS inlet. The distributions have been cleaned of all data from times of instrument malfunction or calibration.\n\nMerged (datasets denoted by _aerosol_sizedist):\nThese datasets include particle size distributions in the diameter range of 0.005 to 10 micrometers Stokes diameter. The distributions are a combination of DMPS and APS size distribution data where the APS diameters have been converted to Stokes diameters using densities calculated from measured chemistry. The diameter channels in the overlap region were chosen in the following manner: the last DMPS channel was discarded and, after converting to Stokes diameters, the first APS diameter channel that was larger than the last valid DMPS channel was chosen as the first APS channel.

The mast extended 5 m above and forward of the aerosol measurement container. The inlet was a rotating cone-shaped nozzle that was automatically positioned into the relative wind to maintain nominally isokinetic flow and minimize the loss of supermicrometer particles. Air entered the inlet through a 5 cm diameter hole, passed through a 7 degree expansion cone, and then into the 20 cm inner diameter sampling mast. The flow through the mast was 1 m3 min-1. The transmission efficiency of the inlet for particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 6.5 um (the largest size tested) is greater than 95% [Bates et al., 2002].\n\nThe bottom 1.5 m of the mast were heated to establish a stable reference relative humidity (RH) for the sample air controlled to the indicated target sample RH. Twenty one 1.6 cm inner diameter stainless steel tubes extending into the heated portion of the mast were connected to downstream aerosol instrumentation with either conductive silicon tubing or stainless steel tubing for analysis of organic aerosol.\n\nDMPS (datasets denoted by _aerosol_sizedist_dmps_):\nOne of the twenty one 1.6 cm diameter tubes was used to supply ambient air to a tandem DMPS system that measured particle size distributions in the range of 0.020 to 0.8 micrometers Stokes diameter. The tandem DMPS consists of an ""Aitken"" DMPS (0.020 to 0.2 um) and an ""Accumulation"" DMPS (0.2 to 0.8 um). The distributions have been cleaned of all data from times of instrument malfunction or calibration.\n\nAPS (datasets denoted by _aerosol_sizedist_aps_):\nOne of the twenty one 1.6 cm diameter tubes was used to supply ambient air to an APS that measured particle size distributions in the range of 0.96 to 10 micrometers Stokes diameter. The APS diameters are aerodynamic and have not been corrected to Stokes diameter via calculation or estimates of particle density. The APS data larger than 10 micrometers are not useful due to significant particle losses in the inlets including the ship's sampling mast, distribution tubing and APS inlet. The distributions have been cleaned of all data from times of instrument malfunction or calibration.\n\nMerged (datasets denoted by _aerosol_sizedist):\nThese datasets include particle size distributions in the diameter range of 0.005 to 10 micrometers Stokes diameter. The distributions are a combination of DMPS and APS size distribution data where the APS diameters have been converted to Stokes diameters using densities calculated from measured chemistry. The diameter channels in the overlap region were chosen in the following manner: the last DMPS channel was discarded and, after converting to Stokes diameters, the first APS diameter channel that was larger than the last valid DMPS channel was chosen as the first APS channel. Each combined distribution was regridded onto a common set of diameters. Finally, the regridded distributions were cleaned to eliminate values at the larger sizes from the APS where ""phantom"" counts resulted in a spurious coarse mode in the surface and volume distributions.\n\nAll datasets include number size distributions (normalized and non-normalized) as well as the higher moments for each: surface area and volume.\n\nAdditional datasets may be included for a give project that include:\n - ambient (_ambient_): includes size distributions shifted to ambient RH using gRH factors\n - filter (_filter_): includes size distributions where additional cleaning was performed for periods of unstable CN concentrations"
